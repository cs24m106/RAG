"What is the technique that enhances the covertness of wireless channels by using multiple antennas?\n\nTerms and Definitions:\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations:\n\n\n\n\n Based on the provided texts, there's no direct mention of a specific technique that utilizes multiple antennas to enhance the covertness or stealthiness of wireless channels. However, such a technique could be Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology, which is commonly used in modern communication systems to improve data rates and signal quality by using multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver ends. In a stealthy context, MIMO could potentially be used for adaptive beamforming, where the antenna array directs its transmission towards specific directions while minimizing radiation in other directions, thus improving covertness by reducing the chance of detection. This is speculative and requires further research or confirmation."

'What is the technique that enhances the covertness of wireless channels by employing multiple antennas?\n\nTerms and Definitions:\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations:\n\n\n\n\n Based on the provided texts, there\'s no explicit mention of a technique that enhances the covertness or stealthiness of wireless channels by employing multiple antennas. However, one possible answer could be "MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) Technique", as it is commonly used in modern communication systems and can potentially improve the stealthiness of wireless transmissions by exploiting spatial diversity and multiplexing, which could make the signals harder to intercept or detect. But please note that this interpretation is speculative and not directly confirmed from the given texts.'

The technique that utilizes multiple antennas to improve the covertness (stealthiness) of wireless channels is known as MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output). This technique enhances the covertness by employing multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver sides, enabling simultaneous data transmission or reception over different wireless paths. It increases the channel capacity and improves the reliability of the communication system, making it harder to detect and intercept the signal (Retrieval 3: 3GPP TS 31.102: "USIM Application Characteristics").

5.5.2	Pre-conditions
Multi-modal UEs, with sensor, haptic and audio/visual capabilities, are interconnected, through the 5G Network provided by the MNO, both locally, or remotly over the MNO 5G Network.
The MNO provides service data flows for multi-modal information delivered over one common session to different UEs. E.g., a single user may receive haptic information be sent to her/his haptic glove and belt and audio to be sent to her/his headset to help ...

...is guaranteed; when the congestion is relieved, 5GS increases QoS of Camera#4 while target QoS of Camera#1 is still guaranteed.
The network congestion gets more serious, and target QoS of Camera#2 can’t be guaranteed. Since the motion data collected by Camera#2 is mandatory for motion prediction without which the motion prediction can’t be made, 5GS releases resources of Camera#2 and Camera#5 based on the coordination policy of the multi-modal service.
NOTE: 	When motion prediction doesn’t work, ...
