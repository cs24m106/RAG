# Telco-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Telecommunications

**Telco-RAG** is a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to address the unique challenges of the telecommunications industry, particularly in handling the complexity and rapid evolution of 3GPP documents.

## Features

- **Custom RAG Pipeline**: Specifically tailored to handle the complexities of telecommunications standards.
- **Enhanced Query Processing**: Implements a dual-stage query enhancement and retrieval process, improving the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Optimized for the best performance by fine-tuning chunk sizes, context length, and embedding models.
- **NN Router**: A neural network-based router that enhances document retrieval efficiency while significantly reducing RAM usage.
- **Open-Source**: Freely available for the community to use, adapt, and improve.

## Getting Started

To get started with **Telco-RAG**, clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netop-team/telco-rag.git
cd telco-rag
```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- Node.js
<br>Other dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation
Install the necessary Python packages and download the 3GPP knowledge database:
```bash
cd ./Telco-RAG_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
```

### Running the Full Pipeline
To run the full pipeline, use the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> The `npm run dev` command is defined in the `package.json` file located in the project's frontend directory. It typically starts the frontend development server.

The above commands use **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install frontend dependencies and start the development server. `npm install` downloads all required packages, and `npm run dev` launches the frontend in development mode.

This will open two terminals: one for the frontend and one for the Telco-RAG backend. You can access the frontend via your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

On your first connection, ensure to specify a valid OpenAI API key in the settings.


#### **Config `package.json` based on platform**
Inorder to launch client & server connections in 2 seperate terminals:
1. For Linux: (choose any one)
> - "dev:api:terminal": "gnome-terminal -- bash -c 'npm run dev:api; exec bash'"
> - "dev:api:terminal": "x-terminal-emulator -e 'npm run dev:api'"
<br>Make sure you have gnome-terminal or x-terminal-emulator installed.

2. For Windows:
> - "dev:api:terminal": "start cmd /k npm run dev:api",

3. For VS-Code:
> - manually launch 2 terminals, 
> - and run `npm run dev:client` in one 
> - and `npm run dev:api` in the other.

4. Default: simply runs both client & server same terminal
> - "dev:api:terminal": "npm run dev:api",


### Running Only the API Server
If you only want to run the API server, use this command:
```bash
cd ./Telco-RAG_api
uvicorn api.deploy_api:app --reload
```
